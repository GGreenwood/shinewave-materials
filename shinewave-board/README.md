This repository contains supporting materials for the upcoming tasks to be completed before the Shinewave Kickstarter.

Shinewave is a project aimed at competitive Super Smash Bros players that seeks to modify and improve GameCube controllers with programmable LEDs and various USB functionalities. The electronics and firmware have already been prototyped and are showcased on my blog at [Electric Exploits](http://electricexploits.net/).

However, official clear controller backs(necessary to see the LEDs) are difficult to find, tend to be in used condition, and cost about $40 each. Therefore, I hope to produce my own replica of the official injection molded backs.

Since I will have full control over the new model, I hope to include several modifications that will make assembly easier and allow for easy USB connections.
